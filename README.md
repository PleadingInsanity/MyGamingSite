### GENERAL USAGE

The Navbar takes the user to the selected page. Clicking on the icon on the left of the navbar will return the user to the index page. The search bar is not currently functional.

### INDEX PAGE USAGE

The index page features a Bootstrap jumbotron. It also displays a Bootstrap carousel of games I am currently playing. The dots on the carousel images are clickable if you want to navigate to a specific image. The page also provides clickable links to some of my favourite Youtube gaming channels.

### ABOUT PAGE USAGE

The about page gives a brief overview of the author and has an animated clickable blockquote that when clicked will animate to another gaming quote. There are currently 3 quotes.  

### FAVOURITES PAGE USAGE

The favourites page allows for some interactivity for the user. The user can like a selected article by clicking the like button and upon doing so the heart icon will fill in. The user can also save a selected article by clicking the save button and upon doing so the star icon will fill in. Saved items will appear on the Saved For Later page.
